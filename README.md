- 👋 Hi, I’m @Domle
- 👀
  
I am a PhD candidate at ETH Zurich shared between the Institute of Microbiology and the Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics. 

I did my Bachelor’s in Ecology at the University of Vienna, and attended the University of Algarve for my masters in Marine Biology afterwards. My master thesis has been focused on taxonomic profiling of the prokaryotic community associated with a soft coral. Since 2019 I am employed at ETH Zurich, where I started out as an intern within the field of global marine plankton diversity and the question of how diversity relates to ecosystem functions, with a special emphasis on aspects affecting global biogeochemical cycles in the ocean.

To do so I use Species Distribution Models that have been developed for modelling regions, that suffer from sparse observations and uneven sampling efforts.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently a PhD candidate at ETH Zurich working on Species Distribtuion Models 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the effects of climate change on marine plankton species diversity and ecosystem functions.
